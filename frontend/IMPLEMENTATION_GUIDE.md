- **ProtectedRoute.jsx** - HOC for protecting routes

### Utilities
- **constants.js** - API endpoints, roles, validation rules, messages, chart colors

## 🔌 Backend API Requirements

The frontend expects a backend API with these endpoints:

```

## 🚨 Common Implementation Issues & Solutions

### Issue: API calls failing with CORS error
**Solution**: Ensure backend has proper CORS configuration and `API_BASE_URL` is correct

### Issue: Authentication token not persisting
**Solution**: Check localStorage is enabled and `STORAGE_KEYS` matches backend token field names

### Issue: Charts not rendering
**Solution**: Verify data structure matches Recharts expectations, ensure data is not empty

### Issue: Routes not protecting access
**Solution**: Verify `useAuth()` hook is returning correct `isAuthenticated` value

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Code Splitting**: Routes are already optimized for lazy loading
2. **Caching**: LocalStorage caches exam drafts and user preferences
3. **Image Optimization**: Use CDN for large images
4. **Bundle Analysis**: `npm run build -- --analyze`
5. **API Optimization**: Debounce search, pagination for lists

## 🔄 Integration Checklist

- [ ] Backend API running on correct port
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] CORS headers properly set
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] Analytics endpoints returning data
- [ ] Frontend can submit exams
- [ ] Results displaying correctly
- [ ] All routes accessible

## 📚 Next Steps
